Before you set up a new project, ensure that the [prerequisites](Prerequisites.md) are met.

The easiest way to get a new project started in PSL is to copy an existing project.
The [examples](Examples.md) are kept up-to-date and exhibit the preferred style for PSL programs.
It is recommended to start there and change the program as you go.
All examples come with a run script (`run.sh`) that will build (if required) and run the example.
